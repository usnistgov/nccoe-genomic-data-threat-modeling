Appendix G: Threat Validation and Prioritization
================================================

This appendix presents the threat validations and ranked threats for the complete example. The PANOPTIC-LINDDUN mapping was employed as part of the validation process to identify LINDDUN threats that might be relevant to specific PANOPTIC attacks. After confirming that these associations could potentially compromise one of the NIST privacy engineering objectives, the threats were assigned values for attack feasibility and difficulty and ranked from high to low priority.
